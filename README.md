## Todos & Ideas

- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for opening the popup and adding the current page to Omnivore
- [x] Improve generation of fallback images (sometimes broken or very low-contrast characters)
- [ ] Optionally load other sets like archived items (via saved searches dropdown?)
- [ ] Cache API results for quicker load times
- [ ] Add possibility to delete items (additionally to archiving)
- [ ] Improve onboarding, e.g. make it possible to enter API key in popup
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Use Omnivore‚Äôs `savePage` API instead of `saveUrl` (to capture page content directly)
- [ ] Internationalization
- [ ] Cache list items locally for offline usage
- [ ] Highlight the popup button if the current page is added to Omnivore
